#Sample Size Calculation t-test (alpha=0.05 and 80% )
ICC = Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of AR-based measurements MCP, PIP, DIPD for each finger (not thumb)
No standard ICC

under 0.40 considered “poor” reliability, an ICC of 0.4 to 0.59 considered “fair” reliability, an ICC of 0.60 to 0.74 considered “good” reliability, and an ICC of 0.75 to 1.00 considered “excellent” reliability.

SEM = square root of MSE term from the two-way ANOVA
MDC = 1.64 * SEM X sqrt_root(2)

Concurrent Validity Analays average of the five AR-Based measuremets to the same joint in-person ROM
Each joint and each camera view


ICC(95% confidence intervals)
For Flexion and Extension positions

Each Finger - Each Joint - Each View

Meetings with Sasha
